# Trading Portal: Blueprint, Roadmap & Prioritization Touchstone

## 1. Vision & Guiding Principles
- Build a robust, scalable, and maintainable trading portal using React + TypeScript.
- Prioritize modularity, testability, accessibility, and developer experience.
- Make tactical and strategic decisions based on evolving realities and learning.

---

## 2. SWOT Analysis

### Strengths
- Modern, modular architecture (React, TypeScript, Context, modular components).
- Clean separation of concerns and scalable folder structure.
- Good developer experience (diagnostics, scripts, scoped styles).
- Foundation for responsive, accessible, and user-friendly UI.

### Weaknesses
- Limited global state management scalability (Context may not suffice long-term).
- Missing authentication/authorization and route protection.
- Error boundaries and resilience mechanisms not yet implemented.
- Limited test coverage and documentation.
- No evidence of internationalization (i18n) or theming support.

### Opportunities
- Integrate robust state management (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, React Query).
- Expand test coverage (unit, integration, E2E).
- Add CI/CD, monitoring, and performance tooling.
- Build a reusable component/UI library.
- Plan for i18n, theming, and accessibility from the start.

### Threats
- Technical debt from rapid feature additions without refactoring.
- Performance bottlenecks as the app grows (bundle size, re-renders).
- Security risks (input validation, API security, auth).
- Onboarding friction without documentation and standards.
- UI/UX fragmentation if shared patterns/components are not enforced.

---

## 3. Strategic Blueprint

### A. Architectural Foundations
- Modular codebase: Maintain separation of UI, logic, state, and services.
- Scalable state management: Plan migration to Redux Toolkit or similar if context usage grows.
- Routing: Prepare for dynamic/protected routes and multiple layouts.
- Error Handling: Implement error boundaries and global error handling.
- API Layer: Centralize API calls, handle errors, and plan for caching (React Query/SWR).

### B. Functional & Non-Functional Requirements
- Responsive, accessible UI.
- Authentication & authorization (if needed).
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E).
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployments.
- Monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.).
- Documentation and onboarding guides.

## 4. Tactical Roadmap & Checklist

### Phase 1: Foundation (Immediate)
- [ ] Document coding standards, folder structure, and architectural decisions.
- [ ] Implement error boundaries in main layout.
- [ ] Audit and expand test coverage (critical logic/components).
- [ ] Add global styles/theming scaffold (CSS variables or styled-components).
- [ ] Review and refactor context usage for scalability.

### Phase 2: Core Features & Resilience (Short-Term)
- [ ] Add authentication and protected routes (if required).
- [ ] Integrate robust state management (Redux Toolkit/Zustand) as needed.
- [ ] Centralize API/service layer, add error handling and user feedback.
- [ ] Implement code-splitting/lazy loading for major routes/components.
- [ ] Expand accessibility audit and improvements.

### Phase 3: Quality & Scale (Medium-Term)
- [ ] Add E2E tests (Cypress/Playwright).
- [ ] Set up CI/CD with automated tests and deployments.
- [ ] Integrate performance and error monitoring.
- [ ] Build and document a reusable UI component library.
- [ ] Plan for and implement i18n/theming support.

### Phase 4: Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)
- [ ] Regularly review and refactor for technical debt.
- [ ] Update documentation as architecture and features evolve.
- [ ] Monitor performance and user feedback, iterate on UX/UI.
- [ ] Ensure all new features/components meet accessibility and test standards.
- [ ] Hold periodic architecture reviews and SWOT updates.

## 5. Prioritization Framework
- **Critical:** Security, auth, error boundaries, state management scalability.
- **High:** Testing, API error handling, documentation, accessibility.
- **Medium:** Performance optimizations, code-splitting, monitoring.
- **Low:** Theming, i18n, advanced UI polish.

---

## 6. Living Touchstone: How to Use
- **Before each sprint/feature:** Review this document to align on priorities and standards.
- **After each milestone:** Update the checklist and SWOT based on new learnings or changes.
- **For new contributors:** Use as an onboarding and architectural reference.
- **For architectural decisions:** Use SWOT and checklist to weigh trade-offs and avoid repeating mistakes.

---

## 7. Next Steps
- Save this document in your repo (e.g., `PROJECT-ROADMAP.md`).
- Review with your team and update collaboratively as the project evolves.
- Let me know if you want to auto-generate checklists/issues from it or customize any section further!

## 8. Cost Optimization & Workload-Aware Architecture

### Principles
- **Separate workloads by cost and frequency:** Serve lightweight/static requests from low-cost infra (CDN, serverless), heavy/model-driven workloads from isolated, scalable infra (cloud GPU, spot instances).
- **Elasticity:** Use serverless and auto-scaling for bursty or rare workloads; persistent infra only for always-on needs.
- **Smart routing:** Use API gateways or edge proxies to direct requests to the correct backend based on workload type/cost.
- **Hybrid approach:** Combine on-premise for baseline with cloud for bursts/high-compute needs.
- **Monitor and adapt:** Continuously track cost and usage, adjusting infra as patterns evolve.

### High-Level Tactics
- Classify endpoints/functions by frequency and cost impact (see mapping doc).
- Map each workload to the most cost-effective infra.
- Automate infra provisioning and scaling (IaC, serverless, managed services).
- Regularly review infra mapping and update as usage changes.

**See `WORKLOAD-INFRA-MAP.md` for detailed mapping and operational playbook.**
