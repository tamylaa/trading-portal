# Trading Portal: Progressive Modular Architecture Plan

## Vision
A scalable, modular platform for Indian and global import/export businesses, built on principles of high reuse, loose coupling, security, accessibility, and performance.

---

## 1. Foundation: Shared Services & Core Capabilities

### 1.1 Centralized Authentication & User Profiles
- Standalone Auth service (OAuth2/JWT/Auth0/Firebase Auth)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Seamless SSO across all modules

### 1.2 Localization & Accessibility
- Support for Hindi, English, and global languages
- Shared localization (i18n) and accessibility (a11y) libraries

### 1.3 Observability & Analytics
- Shared logging, monitoring, and analytics (Sentry, Datadog, Google Analytics)
- Error and performance tracking

---

## 2. First Business Module: Trade Dashboard
- Visualize shipments, compliance, alerts, and quick links to other modules
- Extensible widget-based design (plug in Docs, Compliance, Notifications, etc.)
- Integrates with Auth, Localization, and Observability from day one

---

## 3. Progressive Enhancement Roadmap

### 3.1 Document Management
- Secure upload/download of trade documents
- Digital signatures, document verification

### 3.2 Knowledge Base / Community Stories
- Dynamic, searchable help and user stories
- Community engagement for best practices

### 3.3 Compliance & Calculators
- Automated checks for DGFT, GST, HS codes, etc.
- Currency conversion, customs/GST calculators

### 3.4 Notifications & Messaging
- Email/SMS/WhatsApp alerts for shipments, compliance, workflow events

### 3.5 Integrations
- APIs for customs, logistics, payments, and government portals

---

## 4. Deployment & Integration Strategy
- Each module is a separate, independently deployable app/service
- Integration via REST/GraphQL APIs and shared authentication
- Shared libraries for localization, analytics, and UI patterns

---

## 5. Prioritization Table

| Priority | Module/Service         | Why (Value)               | Deployment      |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| 1        | Auth & Profiles        | Security, SSO, UX         | Standalone      |
| 2        | Localization & a11y    | Reach, inclusivity         | Shared package  |
| 3        | Observability/Analytics| Data, reliability, growth | Shared service  |
| 4        | Trade Dashboard        | Core user workflow        | Standalone      |
| 5        | Document Management    | Business-critical workflow| Standalone      |
| 6        | Knowledge Base/Stories | Community, support, SEO   | Standalone      |
| 7        | Notifications         | Engagement, retention     | Shared service  |
| 8        | Integrations           | Automation, scale         | API-first, plug-in |

---

## 6. Principles in Action
- High reuse: Shared services and libraries
- Modularity/Loose coupling: Each capability is a plug-and-play deployment
- Scalability: Add or scale modules independently
- Security & compliance: Centralized user management and auditability
- Accessibility & Localization: From the start, not an afterthought
- Observability: Data-driven iteration and growth

---

## 7. Next Steps
1. **Design and scaffold Auth & Profiles module**
2. **Set up Localization and Observability as shared services**
3. **Architect and launch the Trade Dashboard as the first business-facing module**
4. Progressively add Document Management, Knowledge Base, Compliance, Notifications, and Integrations as independent modules

---

*This plan will be updated and refined as we progress. Each module will have its own technical blueprint and implementation plan.*
