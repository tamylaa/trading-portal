## Root Cause Confirmed
Cloudflare Pages integration with GitHub broke approximately a month ago (around August 18, 2025) and has been completely non-functional since then. This explains:
1. Why GitHub Actions succeeds but production doesn't update
2. Why asset hashes don't match (production serves bb84949f from a month ago)
3. Why NO debugging changes appeared in production for over a month
4. Why the current production serves commit 39a70b6 content

## Required Action
The GitHub → Cloudflare Pages integration has been broken for over a month and needs immediate attention in the Cloudflare dashboard. This is not a recent issue - it's been broken since mid-August 2025.
