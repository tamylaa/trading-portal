After evaluating all options, Sharjah Research, Technology, and Innovation Park (SRTIP) stands out as the cheapest and best free zone for your logistics startup. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Key Benefits

#### 1. Affordable Setup and TCO
- **Setup Cost**: AED 5,500–12,000, lower than Meydan (AED 12,800), DMCC (AED 10,345–84,515), or IFZA (AED 12,900–17,300).
- **TCO**: AED 10,500–18,000 (2 years + liquidation), among the lowest, compared to Meydan's AED 20,800–25,800.

#### 2. Budget-Friendly Co-Working
- **Cost**: AED 400–600/month for a part-time flexi-desk, included in the license, serving as a company registration point. Fits your AED 750/month budget.
- **Amenities**: Wi-Fi, desks, meeting rooms, ideal for software tools and client calls.

#### 3. Moderate Public Transport Connectivity
- 15–20 km from Meydan or Dubai hubs, accessible via RTA Bus E303/E307 (20–30 min, AED 5–7) from Al Nahda Metro or taxis (~20–25 min, AED 30–50).
- **Route from Meydan**: Taxi to Al Nahda Metro (15–20 min, AED 25–35), Bus E303 to Al Jubail (20–30 min, AED 5–7), taxi to SRTIP (~10–15 min, AED 15–20). Total: ~45–60 min, AED 45–62.

#### 4. High Logistics Access
- Near Sharjah Port (15–20 min), Sharjah International Airport (10–15 min), ~30 min to Dubai Airport, ~40–50 min to Jebel Ali Port. Perfect for tech-driven logistics or freight forwarding.

#### 5. Excellent Liquidation
- AED 2,000–4,000, digital process (board resolution, dues clearance, bank closure), completed in 4–6 weeks.

#### 6. Good Prestige
- Innovation hub, respected for tech and R&D, surpassing UAQFTZ or AFZ but below DMCC or DAFZA.

#### 7. Registration Flexibility
- FZ-LLC license includes flexi-desk, no visa or mandatory seating required, tailored for solo entrepreneurs.

### Drawbacks
1. **Transport**: Moderate connectivity (no metro, reliant on buses/taxis) is less convenient than Meydan's Bus 30 or DMCC's DMCC Metro, requiring trip planning.
2. **Prestige**: Good but not as globally recognized as DMCC, DAFZA, or DIC.
3. **Verification**: 2025 pricing (AED 5,500–12,000 setup, AED 400–600 co-working) needs confirmation due to lack of current data.
