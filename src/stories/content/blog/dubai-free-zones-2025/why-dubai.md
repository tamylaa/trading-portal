## Why Choose a Dubai Free Zone for Your Logistics Startup? {#why-choose-dubai-free-zone}

Dubai is a global logistics hub, with world-class infrastructure like Jebel Ali Port, Dubai International Airport, and Al Maktoum Airport. Free zones offer 100% foreign ownership, tax exemptions, and streamlined business setup, making them ideal for a tech-driven shipping and logistics consultancy.

### Key Considerations:
- **Low Setup Costs**: Budget-friendly licenses for solo entrepreneurs.
- **Co-Working Spaces**: Affordable flexi-desks or shared offices (~AED 400–700/month) that serve as registration points.
- **Public Transport Connectivity**: Proximity to Dubai Metro, RTA buses (e.g., Bus 30), or taxis for easy workspace access.
- **Logistics Access**: Close to ports and airports for supply chain efficiency.
- **Ease of Liquidation**: Simple, low-cost exit processes (~AED 2,000–5,000).
- **No Visa or Seating Requirements**: Flexibility for a 1-person operation.
