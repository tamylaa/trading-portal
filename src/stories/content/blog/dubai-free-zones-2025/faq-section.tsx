### Can I operate outside the free zone with a free zone license?

**Yes**, but with restrictions. You can:

- Conduct international business

**No** for direct UAE mainland sales without additional mainland trade license.

SRTIP (AED 5,500–12,000 setup) is the most cost-effective, followed by AFZ (AED 7,000) and UAQFTZ (AED 6,500).

- **SRTIP**: 3–5 working days
- **Meydan**: 2–3 days
- **DMCC**: 5–7 working days
- **DIC/DMC**: 3–5 working days

### Can I get a UAE residence visa with a free zone company?

**Yes**, but most free zones require:
- Office space (flexi-desks often don't qualify)

- New setup fees
- Bank account changes
- Visa cancellations/renewals

**Tip**: Choose carefully to avoid future migration costs.
