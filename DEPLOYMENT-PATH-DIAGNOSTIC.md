# DEPLOYMENT PATH DIAGNOSTIC

## Multiple Possible GitHub Pages URLs

Your repository might be deployed to multiple URLs. Try visiting each:

### 1. Standard GitHub Pages URLs:
- `https://tamylaa.github.io/trading-portal/`
- `https://tamylaa.github.io/trading-portal/github-actions-test.html`

### 2. Custom Domain (if configured):
- `https://tamyla.com/`
- `https://tamyla.com/github-actions-test.html`

### 3. Possible Branch-Specific Deployments:
- Check if there's a separate staging deployment
- Check if staging-ui branch has its own URL

## What to Check:

1. **Visit the GitHub repo settings** → Pages section
2. **See which branch/source is configured for deployment**
3. **Check if there's a custom domain configured**
4. **Try the raw GitHub Pages URL** (tamylaa.github.io/trading-portal)

## Expected Results:

If you see the **red banner** and **test page** on the raw GitHub Pages URL but not on your custom domain, then:
- GitHub Actions IS working ✅
- Custom domain has DNS/caching issues ❌

If you don't see it on ANY URL:
- GitHub Pages settings are wrong ❌
- Deployment is going to wrong branch ❌
