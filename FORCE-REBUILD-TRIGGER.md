# GitHub Actions Cache Busting

## Force GitHub Actions to rebuild everything

This file forces GitHub Actions to see changes and rebuild from scratch.

Timestamp: 2025-09-18 15:25:00
Build trigger: Force production debug deployment
Reason: Debug components work locally but not showing in GitHub Pages production

## Expected Results After Deployment

1. BasicDebug component should show red box in top-right
2. ErrorLogger should show any JavaScript errors in red banner at top
3. TamylaUIDebugger should show UI components import status
4. CompatibilityTest should show ES module compatibility results

## If Still Not Showing

The issue is likely:
- GitHub Pages aggressive caching
- Cloudflare edge caching
- Service worker caching
- Browser cache

## Next Steps

1. Check GitHub Actions logs for build errors
2. Use browser dev tools on production site
3. Check Cloudflare cache settings
4. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) on production site
