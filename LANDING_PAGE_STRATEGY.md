# Landing Page Strategy & Personalization Roadmap

## 1. Multi-Landing Page Management
- **Goal:** Support multiple landing pages for different audiences (new visitors, registered users, campaigns, etc.)
- **Approaches:**
  - Custom routing logic (React Router, Next.js)
  - Headless CMS (Contentful, Sanity, Strapi, etc.)
  - Feature flag/segmentation tools (LaunchDarkly, Unleash, etc.)
  - Personalization engines (Optimizely, Dynamic Yield, etc.)
- **Practicality:**
  - Widely used in SaaS, fintech, and marketing-driven apps
  - Enables targeted messaging, higher conversion, and better UX
  - Not just for A/B testingâ€”can be used for onboarding, campaigns, and more

## 2. Current State
- Single landing page with consistent but basic layout
- Sections: Hero, Features, How It Works, Trust Badges, Testimonials, FAQ, Contact, etc.
- Visual style: Clean but not yet ultra-professional or on par with dashboard/sidebar

## 3. Next Steps
- **Short-term:**
  - Upgrade current landing page for a more professional, high-converting look
  - Use modern grid, better typography, improved spacing, and dashboard-matching styles
- **Long-term:**
  - Architect for dynamic/personalized landing pages
  - Evaluate CMS or feature flag integration for content flexibility

## 4. Action Items
- [x] Document multi-landing page strategy
- [ ] Refactor current landing page for professional look & feel
- [ ] Research/plan for dynamic landing page management
- [ ] (Optional) Prototype CMS or feature flag integration
