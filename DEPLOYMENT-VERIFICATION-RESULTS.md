# DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION RESULTS

## Test Results Summary

### 1. Site Accessibility ‚úÖ
- **trading-portal.pages.dev**: Responding (Status 200)
- **tamyla.com**: Responding (Status 200) 
- Both domains are live and accessible

### 2. Asset Availability Test üö®
- **Old Asset (main.ba960ce1.js)**: ‚úÖ Available (Status 200, REVALIDATED)
- **New Asset (main.57598d40.js)**: ‚úÖ Also Available! (Status 200, MISS)

### 3. Production Asset Manifest Analysis
**Currently Served (tamyla.com/asset-manifest.json):**
```json
{
  "main.css": "/static/css/main.f943f0d8.css",
  "main.js": "/static/js/main.ba960ce1.js",
  "files": 9 total files (minimal build)
}
```

**Local Build (build/asset-manifest.json):**
```json
{
  "main.css": "/static/css/main.6454832e.css", 
  "main.js": "/static/js/main.57598d40.js",
  "files": 18+ total files (full code-split build)
}
```

## KEY DISCOVERY: Asset Files ARE Deployed!

The test `https://tamyla.com/static/js/main.57598d40.js` returned **Status 200** - meaning our recent builds ARE being deployed to Cloudflare Pages, but the **index.html is not being updated** to reference them.

## Root Cause Refined
This is not a complete deployment failure. Instead:
1. ‚úÖ **Build assets are uploading** (both old and new JS files exist)
2. ‚ùå **index.html is not being updated** (still references old main.ba960ce1.js)
3. ‚ùå **asset-manifest.json is not being updated** (still references old assets)

## This Suggests:
- Cloudflare Pages IS receiving deployments
- Static assets are being uploaded successfully  
- The entry point files (index.html, asset-manifest.json) are not being updated
- This could be a caching issue, build configuration problem, or deployment hook failure
