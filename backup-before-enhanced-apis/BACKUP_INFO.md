## Files Modified in This Session
### Modified Existing Files:
- src/App.tsx (minor modifications)
- src/components/dashboard/ProfessionalDashboard.jsx (added trading widget integration)
- src/components/dashboard/components/QuickActions.jsx (likely minimal changes)

### New Files Created:
- src/api/enhanced/ (entire enhanced API layer)
- src/components/enhanced/ (enhanced components)
- src/store/enhanced/ (enhanced state management)
- src/styles/design-system/ (CSS design system)
- src/config/features.ts (feature flags)
- src/contexts/AuthContext.ts/.d.ts/.types.ts (TypeScript wrappers)
- Various documentation files (PHASE_*.md files)

## Potentially Redundant Files for Cleanup
These files may be candidates for archival after validation:

### Legacy API Files (if they exist):
- src/api/legacy* 
- src/services/api* (old API services)
- src/utils/api* (old API utilities)

### Legacy State Files:
- Large Redux slices that were decomposed:
  - src/store/slices/preferencesSlice.js (if > 500 lines)
  - src/store/slices/dashboardSlice.js (if > 400 lines)

### Legacy Component Files:
- src/components/EmailBlaster.js (if replaced by enhanced version)
- src/components/TradingDashboard.js (if replaced by enhanced version)

### Legacy Style Files:
- Individual CSS files that were consolidated into design system
- Duplicate style definitions

## Recovery Instructions
To revert to this state if needed:
1. `git reset --hard 42f98d7`
2. `git clean -fd` (to remove untracked files)
3. Restore from this backup directory if needed

## Next Steps
1. Identify and backup actual redundant files
2. Test existing functionality thoroughly  
3. Commit enhanced API layer
4. Archive redundant files safely
